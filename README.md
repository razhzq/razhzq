👋 Hey there! I'm Haziq Razak, a self-taught blockchain developer with a strong passion for technology and a focus on web3 development.

💻 I have dedicated myself to exploring the fascinating world of blockchain and decentralized systems. My journey began with self-study, and I have since honed my skills through hands-on projects and continuous learning. I enjoy diving deep into the intricacies of blockchain technologies and the potential they hold for transforming industries.

🔨 As a web3 enthusiast, I specialize in developing decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. I have experience working with various blockchain platforms such as Ethereum and Solana. I'm well-versed in Solidity for smart contract development and have explored frameworks like Truffle and Hardhat for building robust and secure decentralized applications.

🌐 My passion extends beyond just coding. I actively engage with the blockchain community, participating in hackathons, attending conferences, and contributing to open-source projects. I love collaborating with like-minded individuals to push the boundaries of what's possible in the decentralized space.

📚 Continuous learning is a core value for me. I constantly strive to stay up to date with the latest advancements in blockchain technology such as Zero-Knowledge Proof. I believe that understanding the underlying principles is crucial for building innovative and reliable blockchain solutions.

🌟 If you're interested in web3 development, blockchain, or anything related, feel free to reach out! I'm always eager to connect with fellow developers, share knowledge, and explore new opportunities. Let's build the future together!
